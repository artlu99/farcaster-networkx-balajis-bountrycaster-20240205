command line script that downloads the full Farcaster social graph and renders it in networkx.

# Farcaster ü§ù networkx ü§ù balajis ü§ù bountycaster

on 5 Feb 2024, @balajis funded a @bountycaster [bounty](https://warpcast.com/balajis.eth/0x16771738) to show the power of decentralized social media.

$100 in ETH for a command line script that downloads the full Farcaster social graph and renders it in networkx.

This can‚Äôt be done on Twitter without API key as the backend isn‚Äôt open ‚Äî unlike Farcaster!

### Step 0. install `fario` by [@vrypan.eth](https://warpcast.com/vrypan.eth)

- FOSS Farcaster command-line tools at [https://github.com/vrypan/fario](https://github.com/vrypan/fario) (MIT License)
    - on MacOS, simplest method is `brew install fario`
    - on Linux, try `pip install fario`
- The `fario` documentation provides examples of how to specify a Hub.
    - `fario-config make` creates a configuration. Save it to `~/.fario`.
    - The code below expects the Hub address to be stored in the local config file.
    - It may be amended to specify the Hub address as a command-line option, or to point to a load balancer, as exercises left for the reader.

### Step 1. find a Hub

 *as of February 2024*:
 
- [Run your own](https://thehubble.xyz) Hub, like >1,000 others [[Viewer](https://farcaster.spindl.xyz) by [@zachterrell](https://warpcast.com/zachterrell/0x074fe069)].
- [Farcaster](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/architecture/hubs) runs free, read-only Hubs. These are used by much of the community to handle validations required for many Frames actions, and sometimes come under heavy load.
- [Neynar](https://neynar.xyz) runs paid, read-only and read-write Hubs. These are very powerful, and also used by much of the community.
- the community operates several free, open Hubs (read-only + read-write): including Standard Crypto, [Wield/FarQuest](https://docs.wield.co/farcaster/api) (search for "free public hub"), [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/pinata-hub), and [@farcasteradmin.eth](https://freefarcasterhub.com).
- [foss-farchiver](https://foss.farchiver.xyz) by @farchiver maintains a growing open source, distributed list of Hubs, along with viewers and API endpoints to assist with load balancing.

### Step 2. Pre-process

- All follows are stored on the permissionless, decentralized Hub network. It is a network and a protocol, not a blockchain!
- Getting follows from the network can be quick if you already have them.
    - e.g., inside a live Replicator which includes a Postgres database instance.
    - Neynar (paid) and Wield (free, more rate-limited) provide APIs to access their databases.
- anybody can permissionlessly pull the data from Hub(s), by calling the Hub APIs to loop through individual FIDs.

```
> python3 preprocess.py
```

- loop through a range of FIDs and store follows in a local `sqlite3` database.
- the code is ~50 lines. Comments contain more guidance.

### Step 3. Process

- once we download the data, create the social graph in `networkx` and display it.

```
> python3 process.py
```

- loop through a range of FIDs, create nodes and edges, and produce a sample visualization.
- the code is ~70 lines. Comments contain more guidance.

### Step 4. Outputs

- display some calculated network stats, and some timing indications.
- save PNG files in the `out/` folder.
- update the variable `MAX_FID_WHILE_DEBUGGING` around line 13 when all looks good, and you are ready to do larger processing.
